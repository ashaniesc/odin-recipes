                <li>Cut your fish into sections for frying.</li>
                <li>Fill a frying pan up with 1 inch of oil covering
                    the entire surface and heat it over a high fire to
                    heat up the oil.</li>
                <li>In your ziploc bag, combine the garlic powder,
                    onion powder, salt, pepper, flour, cornmeal, and

                    to cover the entire fish. Place your seasoned fish
