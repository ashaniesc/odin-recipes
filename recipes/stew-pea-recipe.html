        <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>This stew pea recipe is a deceptively easy meal to put 
            together, so don't be offput by the list of ingedients.
            This is a meal that can feed a family of five over two days,
            depending on how much you guys can eat in one serving, and
            all out of one pot!</p>
    <br>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>3 scallions</li>
                <li>1/2 an onion</li>
                <li>Coconut cream</li>
                <li>2 tbsp all purpose seasoning</li>
                <li>Garlic powder</li>
                <li>Salt to taste</li>
                <li>Kidney beans</li>
                <li>Turkey necks</li>
                <li>Flour</li>
                <li>Baking Powder</li>
            </ul>
    <br>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Fill a pot with 3 cups of kidney beans and fill the 
                    pot halfway with water and set the fire to high heat.</li>
                <li>Clean your scallions with water and cut the roots 
                    and dead leaves off. Cut the scallions in half and 
                    add them in the water.</li>
                <li>Peel and chop half an onion and add it to the pot.</li>
                <li>Add a bit of coconut cream to the pot.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle two tablespoons of all purpose seasoning 
                    to the pot.</li>
                <li>Add garlic powder and salt to taste. Check every 5 
                    minutes until seasoned to your liking.</li>
                <li>Check to see when the peas are soft by pressing 
                    them with a fork until you find that they are easy
                    to pierce.</li>
                <li>When the water starts to boil, turn the temperature 
                    to medium.</li>
                <li>Once peas are soft, put your turkey necks in the 
                    pot and cover the top. Make sure the water is still
                    boiling lower than the top of the pot.</li>
                <li>Once the water in the pot has turned red and started
                    to thicken from the seasoning, meats, and 
                    vegetables, turn the water low to a simmer until
                    stew thickens to your desired amount.</li>
                <li></li>
            </ol>
